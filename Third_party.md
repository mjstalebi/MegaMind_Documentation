#  Install Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Python
The ASK SDK for Python requires **Python 2 (>= 2.7)** or **Python 3 (>= 3.6)**. Before continuing, make sure you have a supported version of Python installed

First you need to clone the our repository for MegaMind Skill:
```bash
cd $HOME/MegaMind
git clone https://github.com/mjstalebi/MegaMind_Skill.git
``` 
First we need to install python setup tools.
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
```
Then we can install the sdk and use our Skill.
```bash
cd $HOME/MegaMind/MegaMindSkill
python3 setup.py build
source run_MegaMind.sh
```
then open another terminal and 
```bash
cd $HOME/MegaMind/MegaMindSkill
source get_ngrok.sh
source ngrok_run.sh
```
Then we use the public url generated by ngrok to register our Skill with Amazon.
